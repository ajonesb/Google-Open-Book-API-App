# Google Open Book API App

The application uses Open Weather Data API : https://developers.google.com/books/

# Summary of Application

Simple Google Books API application which queries Google books api for any book, consumes the rest Api, and shows the search results query on the UI. The project was created in pure Javascript with JQuery and Ajax to interact with the Google Books Api. 

I originally started in Angular but felt it wasnâ€™t really necessary (for this specific project) plus for setup and building I thought it would be much more efficient and to keep it simple by just going for the simple pure Javascript route and handling the Api with Ajax. 

Depending on the project, in this case, going framework less resulted well for the end result. A very important tip I believe and applied here was to look at the overall whole forest for the solution, not just the trees.

The project can easily be viewed by viewing the main index.html file without any dependancies, packages to compile the application.

# The UI

The UI consists of Bootstrap for the look and feel, responsible mobile. Boostrap is already implemented on the main index.html via Bootstrap cdn's for quick setup and development along with JQuery and Popper. 



# Installation Instructions:

Open index.html and that's it! No dependancies, no packages, kept it simple with Javascript and Ajax.
